      I am a student of design and architecture living in Chicago, but I consider
      myself a mindful observer.  A Texan Jew, my family comes from Algeria,
      Morocco, Israel, Czech Republic, and Poland.  Growing up in a family with
      varying cultures and backgrounds is a piece of my foundation as an observer.
      I juggle divergent opinions and value systems inherent in the traditions of
      significant people in my life, which provides me with an opportunity to view the
      world from multiple perspectives.  What began as a necessity of mental and
      social survival in the family, openness to people's opinions and value systems
      is now a practice that I cannot escape.

      I chose to study architecture at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT)
      because of the rich architectural history associated with the school and
      the city of Chicago.  I also believe the faculty offers a multitude of
      backgrounds from long-tenured professors to practicing architects who can
      provide different perspectives for my education.  The facilities are
      condusive for aspiring designers, which includes a large workshop equipped
      with large and small tools that facilitate many design and build
      scenarios.

      I want to share my travels, designs, and interests while exposing myself
      with opportunities to build relationships with people.  A public presence
      is critical to being found. I hope that this class will spark my ambitions
      of employing a digital interface that bridges these relationships.  By the
      end of the semester, I want to confidently manage an environment that will
      serve as a personal portfolio of my life and work.  Additionally, finish
      with enough knowledge and enthusiasm to continue learning about how to
      develop my content as my work evolves and grows.

      When I finish school, I am open to continuing my studies by pursuing a
      master's degree abroad.  However, my goal is to eventually pursue
      licensure as a professional architect.  As an architect, I plan to
      establish a mindful approach that focuses on site specific and client
      oriented designs, while being open to any type of building use.  I
      believe it is my responsibility to manipulate space and create
      environments for human engagement.
