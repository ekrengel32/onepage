        <h2>HELLO</h2>
          <p>
            I am a student of design and architecture living in Chicago, but I consider
            myself a mindful observer.  I want to become a licensed architect because
            I want to manipulate space and I believe architecture studies the spatial
            relationships between humans and environments.  As an architect, I plan
            to establish a mindful approach that focuses on site specific and client
            oriented designs, while being open to any type of building use.  I
            believe it is my responsibility to manipulate space and create
            environments for human engagement.

        <h2>EXPERIENCE</h2>
          <section class="primary">
            <p>
              I worked as a building designer for a Design/Build firm in Austin,
              Texas.  There are four homes either built or currently under construction
              that my team put together with full attention to client and site needs.
              Additionally, I worked as a CAD expeditor for various clients in the
              city of Austin. One of my clients was the mayor of New Braunfels, Texas.
              I developed a renovation plan for a culinary arts kitchen in an old
              kayak and tubing center for the Guadalupe River, just outside of
              downtown New Braunfels.

        <h2>EDUCATION</h2>
          <section class="primary">
            <p>
              I currently study architecture at Illinois Institute of Technology
              (IIT) because of the rich architectural history associated with the
              school and the city of Chicago.  I also believe the faculty offers a
              multitude of backgrounds from long-tenured professors to
              practicing architects who can provide different perspectives for
              my education.  The facilities are condusive for aspiring
              designers, which includes a large workshop equipped with large and
              small tools that facilitate many design and build scenarios.
