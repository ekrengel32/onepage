        <h2>HELLO</h2>
          <p>
            I am a student of design and architecture living in Chicago, but I consider
            myself a mindful observer.  A Texan Jew, my family comes from Algeria, Morocco,
            Israel, Czech Republic, and Poland.  Growing up in a family with varying
            cultures and backgrounds is a piece of my foundation as an observer.
            I juggle divergent opinions and value systems inherent in the
            traditions of significant people in my life, which provides me with
            an opportunity to view the world from multiple perspectives.  What
            began as a necessity of mental and social survival in the family,
            openness to people's opinions and value systems is now a practice
            that I cannot escape.

              I chose to study architecture at Illinois Institute of Technology
              (IIT) because of the rich architectural history associated with the school and
              the city of Chicago.  I also believe the faculty offers a
              multitude of backgrounds from long-tenured professors to
              practicing architects who can provide different perspectives for
              my education.  The facilities are condusive for aspiring
              designers, which includes a large workshop equipped with large and
              small tools that facilitate many design and build scenarios.

              I want to share my travels, designs, and interests while exposing myself with
              opportunities to build relationships with people.  A public
              presence is critical to being found. I hope that this class will
              spark my ambitions of employing a digital interface that bridges
              these relationships.  By the end of the semester, I want to
              confidently manage an environment that will serve as a personal
              portfolio of my life and work.  Additionally, finish with enough
              knowledge and enthusiasm to continue learning about how to develop
              my content as my work evolves and grows.

              When I finish school, I am open to continuing my studies by pursuing a master's
              degree abroad.  However, my goal is to eventually pursue licensure
              as a professional architect.  As an architect, I plan to establish
              a mindful approach that focuses on site specific and client
              oriented designs, while being open to any type of building use.  I
              believe it is my responsibility to manipulate space and create
              environments for human engagement.
