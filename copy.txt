    Hey everyone, Erez here.  I'm a 2nd year architecture student from Texas and
    I live off-campus in the South Loop.  I enjoy a balanced lifestyle of
    activity and relaxation, so I'm either running along the lake, playing
    sports, and grabbing beers with friends, or reading a book, drawing, and
    practicing yoga.  I love to travel and take photos whenever I get an
    opportunity, so I went to Norway this summer on an IIT architecture summer
    program and had an amazing experience - everyone should see Norway at least
    once in their lifetime.

    Anyway, FEEL FREE to chat with me anytime you like, I'm always open for a
    conversation.
